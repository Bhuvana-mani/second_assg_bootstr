                <p>The art of floristry traces back to Eastern practices. It started with styling flowers to give as presents to loved ones.


                    Later, types of floral design sprung up from Europe, Japan, and China. This led the way for floristry to become an official business.
                    
                    
                    In the east, the oriental style of floral design emphasized the lines of flowers. Its main concern was crafting compositions with a satisfying balance.
                    
                    
                    This comes from their philosophies on harmony and unity. They show this aesthetic through blending flowers and foliage.
                    
                    
                    In the West, the traditional style of floral design prioritized the use of flowers as a whole.
                    
                    
                    It worked towards an asymmetrical style. Through this, it achieved rhythm and inspiration in the mix of blooms and greens.
                    
                    
                    Floristry first developed into a business in the Netherlands in the mid-19th century. Merchants sold pre-made bouquets to their patrons as decoration.
                    
                    
                    Over time, it became an industry offering wholesale orders of flowers. It also provided gardening supplies for the maintenance of flowers.
                    
                    
                    Retail shops also offered freshly-plucked blooms and arrangements. They designed bouquets for a variety of events based on customers' requests.
                    
                    
                    Since the late 19th century, academic institutions have acknowledged floristry as a formal course. Colleges across the Dutch islands were the very first to offer floristry programs.
                    
                    
                    This trend spread across the continent of Europe. Soon enough, it arrived at the U.S., where the industry of flower shops began. Florists then made efforts to keep their status as a growing industry in the market.
                    
                    
                    Today, most flower shops provide delivery services straight to the customer or recipient. They also give the option of placing orders through phone call or their shop's web page.
